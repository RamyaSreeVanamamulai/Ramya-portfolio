# RamyaSree Vanamamulai — Portfolio Website (HTML & CSS)

This repository contains my **HTML & CSS course project**, a personal portfolio website
designed and developed to present my academic background, technical skills, and projects
in a clean and professional manner.

The goal of this project was to practice **core front-end fundamentals** such as
HTML structure, CSS styling, Flexbox layout, and responsive design — without using
any external frameworks or JavaScript.
